# Eat and Split

A small React app where you can add friends, select one, and split a bill with them. The app keeps track of who owes who.

This project is part of my Learning React journey. It builds on concepts I had practiced before and gave me a deeper understanding of how state and props work together in real-world components.

## Reflection

This project pulled together everything I’d learned in earlier exercises (state, props, conditional rendering, controlled forms) and showed me how they all work in a more realistic app.

It’s a small project, but it gave me confidence in breaking down UIs, managing state, and connecting components together.
