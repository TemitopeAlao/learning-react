# 🍽️ React Menu Project

This is the **first React project** I built while learning from Jonas Schmedtmann’s React course.  
It’s a simple food menu app that displays items, allows filtering by category, and updates the UI dynamically.

## 📖 What I Learned

This project introduced me to the **core building blocks of React**:

- **Components** – Breaking the UI into smaller, reusable parts
- **Props** – Passing data between components
- **Rendering Lists** – Using `.map()` to display data dynamically

## 📌 Problems I Solved While Building This

While building this project, I ran into several problems and had to figure them out:

1. **Why my component wasn’t rendering** — I forgot to export it before importing.
2. **`class` vs `className` confusion** — React wouldn’t apply my styles until I used `className`.
3. **Undefined props** — I was passing props incorrectly, so the child component didn’t get the data.
4. **Map key warnings** — Learned to add a unique `key` when mapping over items.
5. **Folder structure confusion** — Deciding where `data.js` and images should live for cleaner imports.

## 💡 Personal Takeaways

Since this was my **first hands-on project** in React:

- I started understanding how **state drives the UI**
- I got more comfortable reading and writing JSX
- I realized how important **component structure** is for clarity
- Debugging felt challenging at first, but I learned to read error messages carefully
- Asking questions (a lot!) really helped me get unstuck faster
