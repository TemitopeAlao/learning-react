ðŸŽ¯ Reflection

This project was a big step in my React learning.
I finally understood how lifting state up works, how components communicate via props, and why immutability in state updates is crucial.

Breaking a project into separate files felt challenging at first, but now I see how it makes the codebase scalable.

If I look back at my first JavaScript-only projects, the difference is clear â€” React makes it easier to think in components rather than just DOM elements.
